Digital Clock Project

Project Overview:
This project is a simple digital clock implemented in x86 assembly language for the DOS operating system.
The clock displays time in a graphical mode and updates in real-time using timer interrupts.
The features include displaying hours, minutes, seconds, and whether it's AM or PM.

This digital clock project is written in x86 assembly language and is designed to run on DOS systems.
It utilizes the VGA graphics mode to display a digital clock on the screen.
The clock continuously updates in real-time, thanks to a timer interrupt that triggers at regular intervals.
